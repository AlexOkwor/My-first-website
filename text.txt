	   <p><h1 align="center">Display Flex</h1>With the inclusion of that simple one-liner, display:flex, a change in layout
	    is immediately seen.
        The list elements are now stacked horizontally, from left to right. Just like they would if you used float.
        The Flexbox model kicks in as soon as you introduce the “flex display” on any parent element.
         As soon as you set the display property to flex, the unordered list automatically becomes the 
         flex container and the child elements (in this case, the list elements li) become flex items.
         </p> </span>

	   <span id="Content2">
	   <p><h1 align="center">Flex wrap</h1>“Wrap” is a fancy word to say, “when the available space within the 
	   	flex-container can no longer house the flex-items in their default widths, break unto multiple lines. 
	   	This is possible with the wrap value; flex-wrap: wrap.
        </p></span>

	    <span id="Content3">
	   <p><h1 align="center">Relative flex</h1>If you already forgot, flex: 1 1 auto is same as setting: flex-grow:
       1 flex-shrink: 1 and flex-basis: auto
       Using the framework I established much earlier, the initial widths of the flex-items are automatically computed 
       flex-basis: auto, and then they “grow” to fit the available space flex-grow: 1.</p>
       <p><h1>Absolute flex</h1>Let’s make the flex-items absolute — meaning this time their widths
        should be based on “flex” NOT content size.
